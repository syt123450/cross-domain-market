                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p>ICON is a global creative commerce platform. We build markets, services and economic opportunity for
                    creative entrepreneurs.</p><br>
                <p>Our service allows users to buy just about anything in a variety of pricing formats and locations.
                    The actual contract for sale is directly between the seller and buyer. eBay is not a traditional
                    auctioneer. </p><br>
                <p>While we may provide pricing, shipping, listing, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is
                    solely informational and you may decide to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the
                    resolution of disputes through various programs, eBay has no control over and does not guarantee the
                    existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content
                    or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a
                    buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p><br>
                <p>Within our markets, millions of people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make,
                    sell and buy unique goods. We also offer a wide range of Seller Services and tools that help
                    creative entrepreneurs start, manage and scale their businesses. Our mission is to reimagine
                    commerce in ways that build a more fulfilling and lasting world, and we're committed to using the
                    power of business to strengthen communities and empower people.</p>
