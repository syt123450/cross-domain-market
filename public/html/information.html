                    resolution of disputes through various programs, Nebula brands, Inc has no control over and does not guarantee the
                    existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or accuracy of users' content
                    or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for items; or that a
                    buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.</p><br>
